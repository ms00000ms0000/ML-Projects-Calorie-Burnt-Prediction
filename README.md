# ML-Projects-Calorie-Burnt-Prediction
This **Machine Learning project** focuses on **Calories Burnt Prediction** using the **XGBoost Regressor** algorithm. The model predicts the number of calories burned during physical activity based on inputs such as **Gender, Age, Height, Weight, Duration, Heart Rate, and Body Temperature**. Extensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** was performed, including the **distribution of Age and Height**, and a **correlation heatmap** was constructed to identify **positive and negative correlations** among features. The model effectively learns complex relationships between physiological data and calorie expenditure, demonstrating how ML can be applied in **fitness tracking and health analytics** for personalized insights.
